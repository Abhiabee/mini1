# mini project : Booklet Lifting Machine For Scanning Internal Assessment Marks
 \Booklet lifting machine to scan internals assessment booklets" act as one of the support
systems of automatic scanning. Here, the pile of booklets is positioned on a tray and then
the tray is lifted. There are many mechanisms to lift the loads like scissor lifting, pneu-
matic lifting, linear actuators etc. Use of linear actuator simplies the work compared
to other methods. The motors are connected to Raspberry pi, which is used to lift the
tray containing booklets. After lifting, the front sheet of the booklets gets captured by
a Raspberry Pi camera. The scanned data will be converted into an electronic form and
it is stored in the memory. Through implementation of scanning, accessibility of data is
rapid and a lot of time is saved. After scanning the booklet, it is driven out of the tray
using rollers. A last page detector (IR sensor) is used for detecting the last booklet and
gives feedback to controller by displaying a completed command. Hence, all the physical
documents are converted into digital format automatically.
